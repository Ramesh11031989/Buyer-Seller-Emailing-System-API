Manage API Tokens

The Manage API Tokens interface allows you to create, list, update, and revoke API tokens.
This interface also allows you to assign Access Control List (ACL) privileges to API tokens.
API tokens allow you to log in to the server without the need for a password.
You can use an API token to authenticate with WHMâ€™s remote API. This is useful,
for example, to allow a reseller or third-party developer to run API function
calls with your account's data.
